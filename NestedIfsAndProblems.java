Develop a program that performs the following:
  Assuming that the variable n has been properly declared and initialized
  Create a method that accepts an integer n and 

  If n is even check if n is divisible by 5 
  If n is divisible by 5 check if n is divisible by 10.

  If n is odd check if n is divisible by 3.
  If n is divisible by 3 check if n is divisible by 7.

  return the largest number n is divisible by
  If only odd return 1
  If only even return 2

  Print your return value.
